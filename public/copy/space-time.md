## The Project

When it comes to planning the minutiae of a busy day, or week, I find myself opening up Google Maps more often than any calendar tool. I use it to help figure out which destinations to hit and in what order: options for places to grab lunch with a friend, grocery stores on the way home, the best time to squeeze in the gym...

Is Google Maps a scheduling tool? Kind of. There's a lot of time-related data in there, but it's primarily provided via plain text.

What if tools like Google Maps were designed with this "time-planning" use case at the forefront of the interface? What could it look like for both place *and* time to be first-class citizens in a personal-planning tool?

This were the questions I sought to explore in my Master's thesis project!
- What good things can happen for personal-planning when you mash-up calendars and maps?
- What interactions and visualizations can be designed to support the intertwining of place and time?
- Rather than treating complex scheduling as a mathematical optimization problem, how can users be supported to choose their own adventures?

I did this work as a graduate student in the University of Toronto's Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) lab, supervised by Fanny Chevalier. In 2021, our full-length research paper was accepted to a top-tier HCI conference, the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST), in 2021.
