## The Project

When it comes to planning the minutiae of a busy day, or week, I find myself opening up Google Maps more often than any calendar tool. I use it to help figure out which destinations to hit and in what order. I might explore options for places to grab lunch with a friend, grocery stores on the way home, the best time to squeeze in the gym, all while taking into account my own personal preferences alongside factors such as location, opening hours, and travel-time.

Is Google Maps a scheduling tool? Kind of. There's a lot of time-related data in there, but it's primarily provided via plain text.

What if tools like Google Maps were designed with this "time-planning" use case at the forefront of the interface? What could it look like for both place **and** time to be first-class citizens in a personal-planning tool?

This were the questions I sought to explore for my Masters of Human-Computer Interaction thesis project!
- What good things can happen for personal-planning when you mash-up calendars and maps?
- What interactions and visualizations can be designed to support the intertwining of place and time?
- Rather than treating complex scheduling as a mathematical optimization problem, how can users be supported to choose their own adventures?

I did this work as a graduate student in the University of Toronto's Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) lab, supervised by Fanny Chevalier. Our full-length research paper was accepted to a top-tier HCI conference, the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) in 2021.

I'll outline a quick overview of my work on the project below, but you can find out WAY more by checking out...

## The Work

An overview of the work I put into this project is as follows:

- Exploring the literature and existing solution-space
- Defining the space-time planning workflow
- Designing and building the prototype
- Designing and performing the user study
- Analysing and coding the study results
- Synthesizing the project into academic writing
- Collaborating with fellow researchers to get the work published!

Here are some gifs of the prototype in action, created in iOS. It was built to elicit feedback on the concepts through the user study.

*Adding places to your schedule.*

*Re-ordering places takes into account travel-time, preventing scheduling conflicts.*

*Groups of places are represented in grey. "One-of" groups represent mutually-exclusive options, whereas "as-many-of" groups act of buckets of unordered destinations.*

*The system picks the permutation that results in the least travel-time by default, but your other options are always there. You can visualize what the different variations look like.*
