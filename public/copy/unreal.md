## The Project

I worked on the early development of an unannounced Unreal Engine 5 project for ~10 months while working as a Gameplay Programmer at Behaviour Interactive. It was my first time working in Unreal!

## The Work

I ramped up quickly on Unreal Engine 5, its built-in networking and replication systems, as well as the Gameplay Ability System (GAS), which was fairly new to the engine at the time.

In the early prototyping stages my tasks varied widely depending on prototyping needs. Later on I found my niche in NPC behaviours: I collaborated closely with technical designers on building out custom Behaviour Tree functionality.
