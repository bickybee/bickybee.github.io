These experience range from video games

My favorite way to work is to collaborate directly with users in a tight iteration-loop. I've done this while...
- building educational games for kids, all-the-while working as a teacher for our target audience, 
- developing game-engine tooling to support technical game designer workflows
- integrating UI screens and animations in collaboration with UI artists


This may come as a surprise, but my favorite kinds of problems to solve are communication problems. Good communication is my guiding star, across all disciplines:
- good code should make sense to other developers, from the line-by-line naming and organization of functions, up to the mental-model driving the system architecture
- good design should communicate funcionality and set user expectations
- good art should communicate a feeling, an atmosphere, a story
- good teaching 

- building things
- interactive experiences
- delightful / playful
- supporting workflows
- working directly with users to understand their needs and problems
- fundamental skills: software engineering + human-computer interaction + art
- domains: games + education
- good design <=> good communication
    - good design = communicating the function of something, communicating expectations
    - good code = besides doing what it should do effectively, it should be written in a way that communicates its functionality, its architecture... uses an understandable mental-model
    - good games = communicate a feeling, an atmosphere, a story
- mental models...
