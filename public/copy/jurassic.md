# The Project
 Jurassic World: Primal Ops was an action-adventure, dinosaur-collecting mobile game, built for Universal Studios as part of the Jurassic World franchise. Players take on missions to rescue dinosaurs across the continuent, growing their dinosaur roster and uncovering each species' special abilities in battle.

The game was launched in 2022. It has since been cancelled, but it entertained tons of loyal fans during its run, with popular gaming channels like [**The Gaming Beaver**](https://youtu.be/4gNaxBiWDhw?si=HZ2DxsNUgDSp2czh) posting regular content about it to YouTube!

# My Contributions

I was a Gameplay Programmer on Jurassic from the very beginning of production all the way through to its soft-launch in multiple countries, continuing to push fixes and new features to the live game.

My main contributions were in the meta-game. I owned several major systems, detailed below:

## The World Map

*The World Map acted as the main hub of the game.*

*An alternative version of the World Map was used for time-limited events.*

The world map acted as a main menu for the game. It was the entrypoint into missions, and it also took on many variations: different mission "nodes" communicate different loot that can be won. An entirely different version of the map, with additional UI, was used for live events.

## Squad Missions

*The main Squad Missions screen. Click on GO to open up the Mission Setup screen!*

Squad missions are timeboxed something something. I worked full-stack to build this feature, defining the logic on the backend and creating the interface in the frontend.

## Mission Setup

*There was tons of data to display on the Mission Setup screen.*

The mission setup screen was the direct entrypoint to a mission, where you set up your squad before embarking! Lots of info to convey here. We reused many of these UI components in other menus of the game, such as your "sanctuary" and squad missions.

## The Rest (FTUE, other UI)
I also contributed to more general-purpose UI systems used throughout the game:
- The FTUE (first time user experience) system
- The toaster notification system
- The universal back-button / back-stack

Yadda yadda the end!
