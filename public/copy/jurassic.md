# The Project
 I was a **Gameplay Programmer** on Jurassic World: Primal Ops, an action-adventure, dinosaur-collecting mobile game built for Universal. I was part of the team for nearly the entire duration of the project, shipping the game in 2022 and staying on for a few months of live-ops as well.

Though the project has since been cancelled, it entertained tons of loyal fans during its run. Popular YouTube channels like [**The Gaming Beaver**](https://youtu.be/4gNaxBiWDhw?si=HZ2DxsNUgDSp2czh) posted gameplay videos regularly.

# Contributing Across the Stack

My main contributions were in the meta-game, collaborating closely with both Game Designers and UI Designers to implement data-driven gameplay features across the stack. Here are some of the major systems that I owned and developed.

## The World Map

The World Map was the main hub of the game, acting as the main entrypoint into all the menus as well as the main gameplay. An entirely different version of the map, with additional UI, was used for time-limited events.

## Squad Missions

Players could send out members of their Handler team and Dinosaur roster on timed Squad Missions, a kind of idle gameplay, to gather extra loot. Each Squad Mission had specific requirements, dictating which Handlers and Dinosaurs were eligible to be sent out.

## Mission Setup

The Mission Setup screen is where players learn more about each Mission and set up their team composition before embarking. This screen was used for both regular playable Missions and Squad Missions, and many UI components were reused in other parts of the game, such as the Sanctuary where you level up your team.
