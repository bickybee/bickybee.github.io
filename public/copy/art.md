# Selected Artwork

A dedicated art portfolio site is WIP. For now, check out a selection of digital illustrations, murals, animations, and figure drawings! You can also take a look at my instagram to see my latest: @bickydoodles.

**A heads up!** Figure drawings do depict nudity! Tastefully, of course.

## Digital Illustration

## Murals

I've worked with StreetARToronto and Bell Box Murals to create public artworks in Toronto. I've also spray-painted works on legal, public walls in Montreal.
