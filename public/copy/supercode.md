# The Project

The SuperCode Saga is a series of educational games 

# My Contributions

I wear many hats on this project. In traditional games-industry terms, my role is most akin to that of a Technical Designer: lots of design, lots of implementation (in the custom SuperCode engine), lots of scripting (in Lua)! I'm also responsible for Instructional Design across the entire project -- the success of the educational aspects of the games is my top concern.

The first collection of games is currently in use at elementary schools and after-school coding clubs, such as CodeNinjas. It's made up of 31 missions, 17 of which I designed and built: including the writing, level design, and programming.

Collectively, over 10,000 missions have been completed by students (and their teachers)!

More collections of games are in development. For the upcoming collection, I was the primary contributor during the design-phase, which involved:
- creating the curriculum
- writing the high-level narrative progression
- designing the instructional activities and challenges

During the implementation phase, my primary responsibilities were to:
- oversee cohesiveness across the project
- implement the delivery of instructional information (through both writing and gameplay)
- polish the final user-experience, through tweaks of the gameplay and integration of additional SFX and visual feedback

*Fun and Important Fact!* Before joining the development team, I was a teacher with Creatubbles. Through SuperCode, I ran online open-studio-like classes with kids and teens, teaching them to code as they worked through their own game projects. This experience was pivotal! I <3 user-informed design!
