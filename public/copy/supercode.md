# The Project

[**SuperCode**](https://www.supercodeclub.com/) is a learn-to-code platform for kids ages 8 and up. At the core of the platform is a 3D sandbox environment where anyone can create their own interactive 3D Worlds, coding them into games and interactive experiences by using Lua.

Building upon this sandbox environment, we've created collections of narrative-driven educational games where students follow stories set in the SuperCode Universe and solve problems with code.

# My Contributions

I lead the **educational design** of our learn-to-code games, defining computer-science learning outcomes and embedding them into the player experience. My work is directly informed by my time spent as a **teacher** for SuperCode. Working directly with users is monumentally informative!

In this role, my major responsibilities are to:

- Design curriculum content and flow.
- Design interactive, instructional activities, challenges, and mini-games.
- Writing instructional content.

As part of our pedagogical philosophy, we engage students by creating fun, immersive settings for learning, and by using narrative to craft meaningful problems to solve. As such, the general game-feel and narrative-flow are my concern as well!

To this end, and because we're a small team, I also contribute significantly to the following:

- Narrative design
- Level design
- Gameplay scripting
- UX design and polish
- Game-feel polish

## Code Missions

**Code Missions** was our first collection of educational games, currently in use by public school-boards, private schools, and STEM learning centers. The Missions leverage an in-game, runtime Lua editor to intertwine coding with gameplay, as well as bespoke mini-games designed for different topics. I designed and developed 17 of the 31 Missions in this collection.

*Unscrambling espionage data as part of a fill-in-the-blanks activity, to help drive home the concept of data types.*

Over 10,000 missions have been completed by students (and their teachers)!

## SuperCode Saga

**SuperCode Saga** combines the core gameplay of Code Missions with a new game-mode called Activities, interactive tutorials that combine sandbox-style building with guided, story-driven learning. This time around, I oversaw development of the SuperCode Saga project as a whole, creating the high-level outline of games, writing briefs for each game, delegating responsibilities as we moved into production, and overseeing cohesiveness across the pipeline.

*The first Activity of the SuperCode Saga, set in a mysterious place called "The Rift" where reality can be altered and "hacked" to their will!*

SuperCode Saga is currently in the process of being deployed to classrooms across North America!
