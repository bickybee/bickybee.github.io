## The Project

SuperCode is a sandbox game where kids can learn to code while creating their own games, built by Creatubbles. Its mission is for kids to have fun while learning about computer science! As part of this mission, SuperCode also creates collections of story-based educational games. Kids learn and practice Lua programming while taking part in the adventures of the characters of the SuperCode universe.

## My Contributions

I wear many hats on this project. In traditional games-industry terms, my role is most akin to that of a Technical Designer: lots of design, lots of implementation (in the custom SuperCode engine), lots of scripting (in Lua)! I'm also responsible for Instructional Design across the entire project -- the success of the educational aspects of the games is my top concern.

The first collection of games is currently in use at elementary schools and after-school coding clubs, such as CodeNinjas. It's made up of 31 missions, 17 of which I designed and built: including the writing, level design, and programming.

Collectively, over 10,000 missions have been completed by students (and their teachers)!

More collections of games are in development. For the upcoming collection, I was the primary contributor during the design-phase, which involved:
- creating the curriculum
- writing the high-level narrative progression
- designing the instructional activities and challenges

During the implementation phase, my primary responsibilities were to:
- oversee cohesiveness across the project
- implement the delivery of instructional information (through both writing and gameplay)
- polish the final user-experience, through tweaks of the gameplay and integration of additional SFX and visual feedback

*Fun and Important Fact!* Before joining the development team, I was a teacher with Creatubbles. Through SuperCode, I ran online open-studio-like classes with kids and teens, teaching them to code as they worked through their own game projects. This experience was pivotal! I <3 user-informed design!
